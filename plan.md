# Sandoog Project Plan

## Project Overview

Sandoog is a platform for managing group savings, featuring two types of groups:
1. **Standard Savings Groups**: Members contribute monthly and can request withdrawals with payback plans
2. **Lottery Groups**: Members contribute monthly and one winner gets the full pot each month

## User Hierarchy

## Database Structure

1. **users** - Extended auth.users with roles and profile info
2. **admin_requests** - Tracks admin role requests
3. **groups** - Main group information
4. **group_join_requests** - Tracks group join requests

### Dynamic Tables (Per Group)
Each group gets three automatically created tables:
1. **group_{id}_matrix** - Contribution tracking with members as columns, months as rows
2. **group_{id}_metadata** - Group settings and status information
3. **group_{id}_withdrawals** - Detailed withdrawal and payback tracking

## Core User Flows

2. View and manage admin requests
3. Monitor platform usage statistics

### Admin Flow

2. Site master approves request
3. New admin creates a group
4. Admin approves/rejects member join requests
5. Admin manages group contributions and withdrawals

### Regular User Flow
1. Signup/Login
2. Join existing group (requires admin approval)
3. Make monthly contributions
4. Request withdrawals when needed
5. Track and make paybacks for withdrawals
